ðŸ“˜ Name : Social Impact Connect ðŸ”— Live Link: https://social-development-by-ubaid.netlify.app

Purpose : To create a community-driven platform where individuals can discover, create, join, and manage local social development events â€” such as clean-up drives, tree plantations, or donation campaigns â€” making it easier for people to participate in meaningful social work and bring positive change to their communities.

ðŸš€ Key Features This project is a community-driven social event platform built with a focus on user engagement, responsiveness, and backend integration.

404 Page : Custom error page for undefined routes to enhance user navigation.

Authentication System : Email/password login & registration with Firebase Authentication, along with Google social login support. Passwords are validated for security.

Protected Routes with JWT : Private pages like Create Event, Manage Events, and Joined Events are accessible only after login. JWT tokens are generated, stored, and validated for secure access.

Responsive Design : The entire application is fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Create Event Page : Authenticated users can create social events with fields like title, description, type (e.g., Cleanup, Plantation), image URL, location, and future-only date selection using react-datepicker.

Upcoming Events Page : Public page showing only future-dated events in a grid layout, with filters and search by event name. Includes "View Event" and "Join Event" functionality.

Event Details + Join Event : Dynamic private route page displaying full event info and allowing users to join. Joins are stored in the database along with user and event data.

Joined Events Page : Shows all events joined by the logged-in user, sorted by event date for easy tracking.

Manage Events Page : Authenticated users can view, update, and optionally delete events they have created. Ensures secure update access only for the creator.

Search & Filter with Backend (MongoDB) : Users can filter events by type and search events by name. Functionality powered by MongoDB queries on the backend.

Dark/Light Theme Toggle : A UI toggle allows users to switch between light and dark themes for improved accessibility and preference.

Home Page Features : Includes a banner, static gallery, newsletter subscription design, and a features section that outlines the platformâ€™s mission.
