          ðŸŽ¯ The story behind Jovent
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
          The idea for Jovent was born from the need to make community service
          more organized and accessible. Many people want to contribute to
          society but struggle to find, join, or manage events in their local
          area. At the same time, organizers often face challenges in reaching
          volunteers and managing participation effectively. Seeing this gap, we
          created a platform where anyone can easily discover upcoming social
          service events, join causes they care about, and even create their own
          initiatives to serve the community. What started as a simple idea to
          help people contribute locally has grown into a platform that fosters
          active citizenship and strengthens communities.
